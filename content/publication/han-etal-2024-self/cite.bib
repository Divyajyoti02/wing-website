 abstract = {Image--text models (ITMs) is the prevalent architecture to solve video question--answering tasks, which requires only a few input frames to save huge computational cost compared to video--language models.However, we find existent ITM video question--answering solutions either 1) adopt simplistic and unintentional sampling strategies, which may miss key frames to offer the answer clues; or 2) sample a large number of frames into divided groups, which the computational sources can not accommodate. In this work, we aim at an efficient sampling method towards the few-frame situations.We first summarize a family of prior sampling methods based on question--frame correlation into a unified one, dubbed *Most Implied Frames* (MIF). Through some primary results and analysis, Through analysis, we form a hypothesis that question-aware sampling is not necessary, from which we further propose the other method *Most Dominant Frames* (MDF).Experimental results on four public datasets and three advanced ITMs demonstrate that our proposed strategies can boost the performance for image--text pretrained models, and have a wide application scenario in terms of model architectures and dataset types.
