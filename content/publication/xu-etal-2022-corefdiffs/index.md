abstract: Knowledge-grounded dialog systems need to incorporate smooth transitions
  among knowledge selected for generating responses, to ensure that dialog flows naturally.
  For document-grounded dialog systems, the inter- and intra-document knowledge relations
  can be used to model such conversational flows. We develop a novel Multi-Document
  Co-Referential Graph (Coref-MDG) to effectively capture the inter-document relationships
  based on commonsense and similarity and the intra-document co-referential structures
  of knowledge segments within the grounding documents. We propose CorefDiffs, a Co-referential
  and Differential flow management method, to linearize the static Coref-MDG into
  conversational sequence logic. CorefDiffs performs knowledge selection by accounting
  for contextual graph structures and the knowledge difference sequences. CorefDiffs
  significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 9.5%, 7.4% and 8.2% on three public
  benchmarks. This demonstrates that the effective modeling of co-reference and knowledge
  difference for dialog flows are critical for transitions in document-grounded conversation.
