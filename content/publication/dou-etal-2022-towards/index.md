abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of knowledge-intensive text-to-SQL,
  in which domain knowledge is necessary to parse expert questions into SQL queries
  over domain-specific tables. We formalize this scenario by building a new benchmark
  KnowSQL consisting of domain-specific questions covering various domains. We then
  address this problem by representing formulaic knowledge rather than by annotating
  additional data examples. More concretely, we construct a formulaic knowledge bank
  as a domain knowledge base and propose a framework (ReGrouP) to leverage this formulaic
  knowledge during parsing. Experiments using ReGrouP demonstrate a significant 28.2%
  improvement overall on KnowSQL.
