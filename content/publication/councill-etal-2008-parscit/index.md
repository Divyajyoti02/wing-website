abstract: We describe ParsCit, a freely available, open-source implementation of a
  reference string parsing package. At the core of ParsCit is a trained conditional
  random field (CRF) model used to label the token sequences in the reference string.
  A heuristic model wraps this core with added functionality to identify reference
  strings from a plain text file, and to retrieve the citation contexts. The package
  comes with utilities to run it as a web service or as a standalone utility. We compare
  ParsCit on three distinct reference string datasets and show that it compares well
  with other previously published work.
