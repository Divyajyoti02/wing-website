abstract: The Association of Computational Linguistic′s Anthology is the open source
  archive, and the main source for computational linguistics and natural language
  processing′s scientific literature. The ACL Anthology is currently maintained exclusively
  by community volunteers and has to be available and up-to-date at all times. We
  first discuss the current, open source approach used to achieve this, and then discuss
  how the planned use of Docker images will improve the Anthology′s long-term stability.
  This change will make it easier for researchers to utilize Anthology data for experimentation.
  We believe the ACL community can directly benefit from the extension-friendly architecture
  of the Anthology. We end by issuing an open challenge of reviewer matching we encourage
  the community to rally towards.
