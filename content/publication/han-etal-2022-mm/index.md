abstract: Existing multimodal tasks mostly target at the complete input modality setting,
  i.e., each modality is either complete or completely missing in both training and
  test sets. However, the randomly missing situations have still been underexplored.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach named MM-Align to address the missing-modality
  inference problem. Concretely, we propose 1) an alignment dynamics learning module
  based on the theory of optimal transport (OT) for missing data imputation; 2) a
  denoising training algorithm to enhance the quality of imputation as well as the
  accuracy of model predictions. Compared with previous generative methods which devote
  to restoring the missing inputs, MM-Align learns to capture and imitate the alignment
  dynamics between modality sequences. Results of comprehensive experiments on two
  multimodal tasks empirically demonstrate that our method can perform more accurate
  and faster inference and alleviate the overfitting issue under different missing
  conditions.
