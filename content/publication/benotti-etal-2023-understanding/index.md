abstract: With NLP research now quickly being transferred into real-world applications,
  it is important to be aware of and think through the consequences of our scientific
  investigation. Such ethical considerations are important in both authoring and reviewing.
  This tutorial will equip participants with basic guidelines for thinking deeply
  about ethical issues and review common considerations that recur in NLP research.
  The methodology is interactive and participatory, including case studies and working
  in groups. Importantly, the participants will be co-building the tutorial outcomes
  and will be working to create further tutorial materials to share as public outcomes.
